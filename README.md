# binary-clock
A simple, JavaScript binary clock in the six column variety (two for hours, two for minutes, two for seconds).

You can see the [Binary Clock in action][binary-clock] without downloading anything.

The clock can be run by simply downloading the project and opening the HTML file in your browser.

The clock can also be run on macOS by downloading and running [Binary Clock.app](./Binary%20Clock-darwin-x64/Binary%20Clock.app). 

It can be read by adding the columns together (where the time is 10:33:25 AM):
